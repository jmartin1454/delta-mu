\begin{abstract}
Future experiments seeking to measure the neutron electric dipole
moment (nEDM) require stable and homogeneous magnetic fields.  The
stability of the magnetic field within a magnetically shielded volume
is influenced by a number of factors.  In this paper, we study one of
these factors, which is the dependence of the internally generated
field on the permeability of the material.  We also provide
measurements of the temperature-dependence of the permeability of the
material, and indicate the extrapolation yet required to adequately
use these measurements to design future nEDM experiments.

\section{Introduction}

The next generation of neutron electric dipole moment (EDM)
experiments aim to measure the EDM $d_n$ with proposed precision
$\delta d_n\lesssim
10^{-27}$~e-cm~\cite{bib:nedm1,bib:nedm2,bib:nedm2.5,bib:nedm3,bib:nedm3.5,bib:nedm4,bib:nedm5,bib:nedm6,bib:nedm6.5}.
In the previous best experiment \cite{bib:pendlebury}, which discovered
$d_n<3\times 10^{-26}$~e-cm (90\% C.L), effects related to magnetic field
homogeneity and instability were found to dominate the systematic
error.  A detailed understanding of passive and active magnetic
shielding, magnetic field generation within shielded volumes, and
precision magnetometry is expected to be crucial to achieve the
systematic error goals for the next generation of experiments.  Much
of the R\&D effort for these experiments is focused on careful design
and testing of various magnetic shield geometries with precision
magnetometers~\cite{bib:brys,bib:afach,bib:fierlingerroom,bib:sturmthesis,bib:patton}.

%\begin{itemize}
%\item General requirements on field, stability of field, stability of gradient.
%\item List all possible factors that can affect field stability -
 % degaussing, vibrations, etc. possibly with additional references.
%\item State the problem addressed in this paper (changes in $\mu$) and
 % the result.
%\end{itemize}
The nEDM experiment at TRIUMF aims to determine $\delta d_n\sim
10^{-27}~e\cdot$cm. A DC magnetic field of typically $B_0=1~\mu$T is
used to provide the quantization axis for the UCN, normally directed
vertically in the apparatus.  The experimental cycle involves a Ramsey
sequence, where the UCN spins are oriented into the horizontal plane
by applying an oscillating horizontal $B_1$ field, followed by a free
precession period, then an additional application of a second $B_1$
pulse coherent in phase with the first.  The UCN are then drained from
the measurement cell and the number of UCN in both the spin-up state
and spin-down state are counted.  By varying the $B_1$ oscillation
frequency, the central resonant frequency may be deduce with high
precision.  Normally four fills of the measurement cell, with four
different $B_1$ frequencies are used to extract the resonant
frequency.  In order to extract $d_n$, the resonant frequency
measurement is conducted with an electric field $E$ oriented parallel
to the main $B_0$ field, and then again with $E$ oriented antiparallel
to the main $B_0$ field.  A problem in these experiments is if the
magnetic field drifts over the course of the measurement period, it
worsens the statistical precision with which $d_n$ can be determined.
For a $\delta d_n\sim 10^{-27}~e\cdot$cm measurement, the average
field over one fill of the measurement cell must be known to the 10~fT
level or better (which occurs typically on a timescale of 100~s), and
the field is seldom stable to this level.  For this reason,
experiments use a comagnetometer and/or surrounding atomic
magnetometers to correct the magnetic field to this
level~\cite{something,somethingelse,somethingelse2}.  In order for
this correction technique succeed, gradient fields must be controlled
or corrected for at the $<1$~nT/m level.  Furthermore the stability of
the $B_0$ field must be controlled as well as possible, normally at
the 1-10~pT level over the UCN free-precession time.

The $B_0$ magnetic field generation system for a typical nEDM
experiment comprises a coil placed within a passively magnetically
shielded volume.  The passive magnetic shield is generally composed of
a multi-layer shield formed from thin shells of high-permeability
metal (mu-metal).  The outer layers of this shield are normally
cylindrical \cite{bib:} or forming the walls of a magnetically
shielded room \cite{bib:}.  The innermost magnetic shield is normally
a specially shaped shield, where the design of the coil in relation to
shield is carefully taken into account to achieve adequate
homogeneity.

%The active compensation system will be used to reduce the external
%magnetic field at the measurement site to $\mu$T level and prevent the
%saturation of the passive magnetic shields.

Mechanical and temperature changes of the passive magnetic
shielding~\cite{bib:voigt,bib:thiel}, and the demagnetization
procedure~\cite{bib:thiel,bib:fierlinger2016}, affect the stability of
the magnetic field within magnetically shielded
rooms.
%~\cite{bib:thiel,bib:altarev2014,bib:altarev2015,bib:voigt}.  
Active stabilization of the magnetic field surrounding magnetically
shielded rooms can also improve the internal
stability~\cite{bib:franke,bib:voigtorthielorwhat?}.  In nEDM
experiments, care must also be taken to stabilize the current supplied
to the $B_0$ coil~\cite{someoneagain}, and the coil must be stabilized
mechanically relative to the magnetic shielding as well.

% Jeff says: I question whether altarev2014 or 2015 actually say
% anything about magnetic stability.

One additional affect, which is the subject of this paper, relates to
the fact that the $B_0$ coil in most nEDM experiments is magnetically
coupled to the innermost magnetic shield.  If the magnetic properties
of the innermost magnetic shield would change as a function of time,
it then results in a source of instability of $B_0$.  In the present
work, we sought to estimate this effect, and to characterize one
possible source of instability: changes the magnetic permeability
$\mu$ of the material with temperature.

While the senstivity of magnetic alloys to temperature variations has
been characterized in the past~\cite{bib:couderchon,bib:kruppvdm}, we
sought to make these measurements in regimes closer to the operating
parameters relevant to nEDM experiments.  For these alloys, it is also
known that the magnetic properties are set during the final annealing
process~\cite{bib:gupta,bib:bozorth,bib:kruppvdm}.  In this spirit we
performed our measurements on small witness cylinders that were
annealed using the process typically used in setting these properties.



%The temperature dependence of $\mu$ has been measured from two different approaches and the overall result found to be 0.1\%/K $<\frac{1}{\mu} \frac{d\mu}{dT}<$2.3\%/K.

\section{Sensitivity of Internally Generated Field to Permeability of the Shield $B_0(\mu)$}

\subsection{Analytical Calculations in Spherical (and Cylindrical) Geometry}


%\begin{itemize}
%\item State basic physics of problem, define reaction factor, note
%  return flux through shield, etc.
%\item State formulae and results for reasonable parameters.
%\item Possibly one graph of $B_0(\mu)$ with both geometries.
%\end{itemize}

The presence of a coil inside the innermost passive shield turns the
shield into a return yoke and it is due to the penetration of the
magnetic field flux into the magnetic shield.  The ratio of the
magnetic field inside the coil in the presence of the magnetic shield
to that of the coil in free space is called the reaction
factor~\cite{bib:read_our_other_paper_for_some_references_that_say_this}.
Normally the reaction factor is larger than unity for spherical and
cylindrical geometries.  The key issue of interest for this work is
the dependence of the reaction factor on $\mu$.  This factor can be
calculated analytically for spherical and cylindrical
geometries~\cite{bib:bidinosti,bib:some_paper_from_1899}.  Although
the dependence of the reaction factor on $\mu$ is rather weak for
these geometries, the constraints on $B_0$ stability are very
stringent.  Thus a small change in the magnetic properties of the
innermost shield can result in an unacceptably large change in $B_0$.

a magnetic shield with the inner radius of $0.57$~m and a thickness of

dimensions of the ILL nEDM experiment
geometry~\cite{bib:baker,bib:knecht}.

\subsection{Magnetostatic Simulation Results \label{sec:femm}}

Finite-element analysis simulations were conducted to analyze the
effect of discretizing the surface current, and to test the geometry
dependence of the sensitivity of the experiment to changes in $\mu$.
Two axially symmetric simulations were conducted using
FEMM~\cite{bib:femm}.  In the first simulation, the same spherical
geometry was used as for the analytical calculations.  However, the
surface current was discretized to 50 individual circular wires,
inscribed onto a sphere, and equally spaced vertically (i.e.~a
discrete cos$\theta$ coil).  A square sire profile of side length 1~mm
was used.  As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Magnetic_Field}, this simulation
gave good agreement with the analytical calculation.

As an example of one additional axially symmetric geometry, a solenoid
within a cylindrical shield was simulated, with equal coil spacings.
In the limit of infinite $\mu$, the image currents in the end caps of
the shield are an infinite series of coils, giving an ideal infinite
solenoid with a uniform field.  Again, fifty discrete coils were
simulated, where the spacing from an end coil to the inner face of the
shield end-cap being half the inter-coil spacing, as appropriate to
generate the correct image currents in the infinite $\mu$ limit. 

As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Magnetic_Field}, the slope of $B(\mu)$ is
somewhat steeper, and similar in magnitude to the spherical case.  We
therefore estimate that the scale of the sensitivity of a generic nEDM
experiment to global changes in the magnetic permeability is
$\frac{\mu}{B}\frac{dB}{d\mu}\sim 0.01$.

In the spherical case the reaction factor is 1.39, meaning that the
field generated by the spherical coil is amplified by this
multiplicative factor by the presence of the magnetic shield (flux
return).  In the cylindrical case the reaction factor is 1.35.  If the
reaction factor is closer to unity, the calculated
$\frac{\mu}{B}\frac{dB}{d\mu}$ will be smaller, and the EDM experiment
less sensitive to changes in $\mu$.  The results in the two geometries
show that there is also a weaker geometry dependence to this
statement.


%\begin{itemize}
%\item I think it would be easy to provide results in axisymmetric
%  geometries from FEMM.
%\item If any result is available from OPERA, it could be included here.
%\item Results should be for a restricted set of possible nEDM coils.
%\item quote reaction factors?
%\item One graph?  % probably the same graph as above
%\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Field within the passive flux return for EDM experiments}

For a high-$\mu$ innermost shield, the magnetic field lines emanating
from the coil all return through the shield.  This principle can be
used to estimate the magnetic field internal to the material, and in
our studies gave good agreement with FEA-based simulations.  For the
cylindrical geometry described in Sec.~\ref{sec:femm}, the $B$ field
is largest in the side walls of the cylindrical flux return, attaining
a maximum value of 170 $\mu$T.  At $\mu_r$=20,000 (a typical realistic
value for the DC value of $\mu_r$ in these shields), the $H$ field
would be 0.007~A/m.

% Jeff got to here on second pass.

% Taraneh to do: state B, H in the material arising from these
% simulations.  (It can be calculated in FEMM very easily, and will
% agree perfectly with analytical calculation.  Perhaps we should just
% look it up in the FEMM simulation.)

% State principle of conservation of flux, useful for analytical
% calculations.

% Note that the value is therefore very weakly dependendent on mu.

% Jeff to do: this is not enough information and needs to be edited
% and likely increased.  Need to create a task list and gather more
% numbers.

\subsection{Self-Shielded Coils}

A way to decouple the internal coil from the magnetic shield is to
design a self-shielded
coil~\cite{bib:cpviolwithoutstrangeness,bib:someotherselfshieldedcoilpapers}.
In self-shielded coils, the return flux is provided by a second larger
coil, rather than through the permeable material of the magnetic
shield.  In a perfect self-shielded coil, the field at the position of
the magnetic shield would be zero, resulting in a reaction factor that
is identically unity.

Such coils would completely decouple the properties of the magnetic
shield from the homogeneity and stability of the coil itself.  Changes
in $\mu$ of the shield material would then have no impact on the nEDM
experiment.  Coils incorporating self-shielding in their design are
therefore an attractive option for nEDM
experiments~\cite{bib:cpviolwithoutstrangeness}.


%\begin{itemize}
%\item Explain principle (reaction factor = 1, or no field at shield so
%  no return flux)
%\item Simple analytic results - reaction factor is identically unity.
%\item FEMM/OPERA - demonstrate that sensitivity is reduced by factor
%  of XX for simple geometry.
%\item One graph, or include on previous graph?
%\end{itemize}

\subsection{Summary of $B_0(\mu)$}

For shield-coupled coils, the magnetic field in the region interior
to the coil is coupled to the properties of the magnetic shell which is caused
by the penetration of the magnetic field flux into the shell material. In a
typical nEDM experiment, the sensitivity of the internal magnetic
field to changes in $\mu$ is $\frac{\mu}{B}\frac{dB}{d\mu}\sim 0.01$.
The coupling can be much reduced by replacing the shield-coupled coils
with the self-shielded coils.

Neutron EDM experiments are DC measurements with frequencies smaller
than 0.01 Hz. The applied static magnetic field is typically
1~$\mu$T. This produces a $B$ field of 170~$\mu$T and an $H$ field of
0.007~A/m internal to the shield material for dimensions described in
Sec. \ref{sec:femm}.
% Taraneh asking: Is it good enough?
% Jeff's answer:  no it is not!
% Jeff to do:  fix this and make a more clear task list.

% Taraneh to do: Summarize B,H,f relevant for EDM experiments as well.

\section{Measurements of $\mu(T)$}

\subsection{Previous Measurements and their Relationship to nEDM Experiments\label{previousmeasurement}}

The interest in the soft magnetic alloys and their properties have
been increased in the last few
decades~\cite{bib:pfeifer,bib:bozorth,bib:couderchon}. Couderchon et
al. measured the thermal variation of $\mu$ of two different Ni-Fe
alloys in a low field and they found
$\frac{1}{\mu}\frac{d\mu}{dT}\simeq$1\%/K at room
temperature~\cite{bib:couderchon}. Based on the data sheet of a
similar material, $\mu$ would depend on temperature as
$\frac{1}{\mu}\frac{d\mu}{dT}\simeq$0.3-0.7\%/K~\cite{bib:kruppvdm}. These
are measurements of the temperature dependence of $\mu$ at frequencies
much higher than the nEDM experiment (50~Hz compared to 0.01~Hz). 
The applied $B$ field in these measurements was at the order of $\mu$T. For the first technique the internal $B$ field was at the order of 100~$\mu$T and the internal $H$ field at $\mu$=20000 was a few mA/m. In the second technique, the internal $B$ field was at the order of $10^{-3}$T while the $H$ field was at the order of $0.1$~$\mu$T. In those measurements, the applied frequency was 1~Hz.
However, for the nEDM measurement, the internal $B$ field is at the order of $\mu$T and the internal $H$ field is very small and at the order of $10^{-5}$ A/m while the applied frequency is less than 0.01~Hz.

% It used to be written here that neither B, H, nor f were very clear
% in either Coucherdon or Krupp-VDM.

% Taraneh to do: actually, both are very clear.  Find out what they
% are and relate them here.


The goal of our experiments was to develop techniques to characterize
the material properties of our own magnetic shields, as they relate to
EDM experiments.  We created a prototype magnetic shield system in
support of this and other precision magnetic field work.  The
prototype passive shield at the University of Winnipeg is a four-layer
mu-metal shield. The inner radius of the innermost shield is 18.44 cm
which is equal to its half length. The radius of the next shield is
larger by a factor of 1.27.
%shielding factor measurements
The three inner passive shields are assembled and the shielding factor of each individual shield as well as the assembled geometry have been measured. The measurements were done at 0.1,1,10,30 and 60~Hz and at 3.5~$\mu$T and 35~$\mu$T axial and transverse applied field. 

% Taraneh says: I don't know which values are relevant here. Axial or transverse field? 35 or 3.5~\mu T????
% The results are in the first few pages of my summary.

% To do (Taraneh and/or Russ): describe prototype magnetic shielding
% system parameters.  It would be worthwhile to describe briefly the
% shielding factor measurements that were done, as well, I think.  And
% it should be mentioned that normally the inner three shields are
% used.

In our studies of the material properties of these magnetic shields,
two different approaches to measure temperature dependence of $\mu$
were pursued.  Both approaches involved experiments done using witness
cylinders, which are smaller open-ended cylinders (6'' in length) made
of the same material and annealed at the same time as the prototype
magnetic shields.  We therefore expect they have the same magnetic
properties as the larger prototype shields, and they have the
advantage of being smaller and easier to perform measurements with.



%\begin{itemize}
%\item Coucheron et al.?
%\item Krupp-VDM data sheet?
%\item Proper literature search on past measurements of $\mu(T)$.
%
%
% Taraneh to do:
%\item State caveats in order to use these:  dependence on B, H, f.
%\item State typical B, H, f that nEDM needs.  Motivates additional
% measurements.
%\end{itemize}

The two techniques used were:
\begin{enumerate}
\item to measure the axial shielding factor of the witness cylinder as
  a function of temperature, and
\item to measure the temperature-dependence of the slope of a minor
  B-H loop, using the witness cylinder as a transformer core.
\end{enumerate}
We now discuss the details and results of each technique.

\subsection{Summary of $\mu(T)$}

Each measurement (axial shielding factor measurement, or transformer
core measurement) is of the temperature dependence of an effective
$\mu$, done in an AC mode at a particular driving amplitude of $H(t)$.

In the axial shielding factor case, we found
0.6\%/K~$\lesssim\frac{1}{\mu}\frac{d\mu}{dT}\lesssim 2.7\%$/K, with
the measurement being conducted with a typical $H$-amplitude of XXX
and at a frequency of 1~Hz.  In the transformer core case, we found
0.1\%/K~$\lesssim\frac{1}{\mu}\frac{d\mu}{dT}\lesssim 2.1\%$/K, with
the measurement being conducted with a typical $H$-amplitude of
0.1~A/m and at a frequency of 1~Hz.

Our desire is to provide information relevant to EDM experiments where
the coil would couple to innermost magnetic shield in the experiment.
We think it would be reasonable to assume that for the parameters
relevant to EDM experiments ($H$ of typically XXX and frequencies
$<0.01$~Hz), the temperature dependence of the effective permeability
could be of similar scale to these measurements
i.e.~$\frac{1}{\mu}\frac{d\mu}{dT}$ ranging from 0.1 to 2.7\%/K.

\section{Summary and Conclusions}


Neutron EDM experiments are typically designed with the DC coil being
magnetically coupled to the innermost magnetic shield.  If the
magnetic permeability of the shield changes, this results in a change
in the field in the measurement region by an amount
$\frac{\mu}{B}\frac{dB}{d\mu}\sim 0.01$.  Temperature changes could
result in such changes, and it is those temperature changes we sought
to constrain by measurement.

The temperature dependence of $\mu$ has been measured by two different
techniques using open-ended mu-metal cylinders with 6 inches in
length.  We summarize the overall result as
0.1\%/K$<\frac{1}{\mu}\frac{d\mu}{dT}<$2.7\%/K, where the range is
driven in part by material properties of the different mu-metal
cylinders, and in part by fluctuations measured in the temperature
slopes in each measurement.

We provide this range with the following caveats:
\begin{itemize}
\item The measurement techniques rely on considerably larger
  frequencies and $H$-fields than those relevant to typical nEDM
  experiments.  For frequency, both techniques typically used a 1~Hz
  AC field, whereas for nEDM experiments the field is DC and stable at
  the 0.01~Hz level.  Furthermore, in one measurement technique the
  amplitude of $H$ was $\sim XXX$ and in the other was $\sim 0.1$~A/m,
  while for nEDM experiments $H\sim XXX$ and is DC.
\item Both measurement techniques extract an effective $\mu$ that
  describes the slope of minor loops in B-H space.  A more correct
  treatment would include a more comprehensive accounting of
  hysteresis in the material, which is beyond the scope of this work.
\end{itemize}


Assuming our measurement of
0.1\%/K$<\frac{1}{\mu}\frac{d\mu}{dT}<$2.7\%/K and the generic EDM
experiment sensitivity of $\frac{\mu}{B}\frac{dB}{d\mu}\sim 0.01$
results in a temperature dependence of the magnetic field in a typical
EDM experiment of $\frac{dB}{dT}=10-270$~pT/K.  To achieve a goal
$\sim pT$ stability in the internal field for EDM experiments, the
temperature of the innermost magnetic shield in the EDM experiment
should then be controlled to 0.1-0.004~K level.  This could be a
serious problem for future nEDM experiments.  The dependence could be
reduced significantly by using self-shielded coils in the EDM
experiment, which would reduce the coupling to the innermost magnetic
shield.





%The next step is to measure $\mu(T)$ for the nEDM setup with different
%coil geometries to achieve the best stability.



%\begin{itemize}
%\item We determined $dB_0/d\mu$.  For reasonable parameters its $\sim$ XXX.  For self-shielded it's reduced by a factor of XXX for realistic windings.
%\item We measured $d\mu/dT$.  We constrained it to be in the range 0.1
 % to 2.3 percent per Kelvin.  Dominant errors are XXX for each method.
  %Neither method is for correct B, H, f.  Both methods are very
  %difficult to achieve consistent sub-percent determinations, but tend
  %to agree on sign and magnitude of problem.
%\item Results imply temperature stability to XXX Kelvin for stability
 % goal of XXX pT.  Show that this could be a dominant issue for
  %stability for future experiments.  Not addressed by many other
  %measurements which tend to focus on stability at zero field or
  %overall stability in full EDM experiment.
%\item Future work: build full EDM experiment.  Capability of various
 % internal coil geometries and best achievable temperature stability
  %are both important to success.
%\end{itemize}
