\begin{abstract}
Future experiments seeking to measure the neutron electric dipole
moment (nEDM) require stable and homogeneous magnetic fields.  The
stability of the magnetic field within a magnetically shielded volume
is influenced by a number of factors.  In this paper, we study one of
these factors, which is the dependence of the internally generated
field on the permeability of the material.  We also provide
measurements of the temperature-dependence of the permeability of the
material, and indicate the extrapolation yet required to adequately
use these measurements to design future nEDM experiments.

\section{Introduction}

The next generation of neutron electric dipole moment (EDM)
experiments aim to measure the EDM $d_n$ with proposed precision
$\delta d_n\lesssim
10^{-27}$~e-cm~\cite{bib:nedm1,bib:nedm2,bib:nedm2.5,bib:nedm3,bib:nedm3.5,bib:nedm4,bib:nedm5,bib:nedm6,bib:nedm6.5}.
In the previous best experiment \cite{bib:pendlebury}, which discovered
$d_n<3\times 10^{-26}$~e-cm (90\% C.L), effects related to magnetic field
homogeneity and instability were found to dominate the systematic
error.  A detailed understanding of passive and active magnetic
shielding, magnetic field generation within shielded volumes, and
precision magnetometry is expected to be crucial to achieve the
systematic error goals for the next generation of experiments.  Much
of the R\&D effort for these experiments is focused on careful design
and testing of various magnetic shield geometries with precision
magnetometers~\cite{bib:brys,bib:afach,bib:fierlingerroom,bib:sturmthesis,bib:patton}.

%\end{itemize}
The nEDM experiment at TRIUMF aims to determine $\delta d_n \sim
10^{-27}$ e$\cdot$cm. This level of precision requires a 1 $\mu$T
magnetic field with the homogeneity of $<$ 1 nT/m and the stability of
pT over the UCN free-precession time.

The magnetic field system for the future nEDM experiment at TRIUMF comprises the components used to null environment magnetic fields and provide a stable homogeneous static magnetic field. It includes an active compensation system, a magnetically shielded room (MSR), several more layers of passive shielding, and  an internal coil system.
The active compensation system will be used to reduce the external magnetic field at the measurement site to $\mu$T level and prevent the saturation of the passive magnetic shields.
The passive shielding system nullifies the residual background fields to the pT level with a two-stage system including a 2-layer MSR and a smaller 3-layer shield that fits inside the room and surrounds the nEDM apparatus.
Mechanical and temperature changes of this system and the demagnetization procedure of the passive magnetic shielding will affect the stability of the magnetic field within the measurement volume\cite{bib:thiel,bib:altarev2014,bib:altarev2015,bib:voigt}.

The passive shields for the nEDM experiments are made of highly
permeable materials such as Mu-Metal which is an Ni-Fe alloy that
allows measurements at low frequency magnetic fields. These alloys
operate at room temperature and are sensitive to small temperature
variations which affects the electromagnetic behaviour of the material
such as the magnetic permeability, $\mu$ \cite{bib:couderchon,bib:kruppvdm}. For
these type of alloys $\mu$ depends also on the annealing process
\cite{bib:gupta,bib:bozorth}. The temperature dependence of $\mu$ has been
measured from two different approaches and the overall result found to
be 0.1\%/K $<\frac{1}{\mu} \frac{d\mu}{dT}<$2.3\%/K.

%\item State formulae and results for reasonable parameters.
%\item Possibly one graph of $B_0(\mu)$ with both geometries.
%\end{itemize}

The presence of a coil inside the innermost passive shield turns the shield into a return yoke and it is due to the penetration of the magnetic field flux into the magnetic shield. The ratio of the magnetic field inside the coil in the presence of the magnetic shield to the coil in free space can be called the reaction factor $C$ which is $>$ 1 for spherical and cylindrical geometries~\cite{bib:bidinosti}. The coupling of the coil to the innermost layer of the magnetic shield suggests that any changes in the properties of the magnetic shield gives rise to a change in the internal field. One of these properties is $\mu$ which is of significant importance because of the high permeability of the passive shields. As a result, the stability of the magnetic shields contributes to the stability of the internal field.

a function of relative $\mu_r=\mu/\mu_0$ for coil radius 0.53~m inside a magnetic shield with the inner radius of $0.57$~m and a thickness of 1.5~mm which are
comparable to the dimensions of the ILL nEDM experiment
geometry~\cite{bib:baker,bib:knecht}.

For a 10\% change in relative $\mu$ (from 20000 to 22000), the
magnetic field changes by 0.7 nT.



\subsection{Magnetostatic Simulation Results}

Finite-element analysis simulations were conducted to analyze the
effect of discretizing the surface current, and to test the geometry
dependence of the sensitivity of the experiment to changes in $\mu$.
Two axially symmetric simulations were conducted using
FEMM~\cite{bib:femm}.  In the first simulation, the same spherical geometry was
used as for the analytical calculations.  However, the surface current
was discretized to 50 individual circular wire, inscribed onto a
sphere, and equally spaced vertically (i.e.~a discrete sin$\phi$
coil).  A square coil profile of side length 1~mm was used.  As shown
in Fig.~\ref{fig:Magnetic_Field}, this simulation gave good agreement
with the analytical calculation.

As an example of one additional axially symmetric geometry, a solenoid
within a cylindrical shield was simulated, with equal coil spacings.
In the limit of infinite $\mu$, the image currents in the end caps of
the shield are an infinite series of coils, giving an ideal infinite
solenoid with a uniform field.  Again, fifty discrete coils were
simulated, where the spacing from an end coil to the inner face of the
shield end-cap being half the inter-coil spacing, as appropriate to
generate the correct image currents in the infinite $\mu$ limit. 
%******************************************
% Taraneh : I commented out these parts because the conclusion is not consistent with the calculation of the reaction factor

%******************************************
 %As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Magnetic_Field}, the slope of $B(\mu)$ is
%somewhat steeper, and similar in magnitude to the spherical case.  We
%therefore conclude that the scale of the sensitivity of a generic nEDM
%experiment to global changes in the magnetic permeability is
%$\frac{\mu}{B}\frac{dB}{d\mu}\sim 0.01$.

In the spherical case the reaction factor is 1.39.  In the cylindrical
case the reaction factor is 1.35.  
%In general, it is expected that the
%larger the reaction factor, the large the sensitivity of the
%experiment to changes in the permeability of the shield.  This
%conclusion is also borne out by Fig.~\ref{fig:Magnetic_Shield}, in
%that the slope of the cylindrical simulation is steeper than that of
%the spherical simulation.

%\begin{itemize}
%\item I think it would be easy to provide results in axisymmetric
%  geometries from FEMM.
%\item If any result is available from OPERA, it could be included here.
%\item Results should be for a restricted set of possible nEDM coils.
%\item quote reaction factors?
%\item One graph?  % probably the same graph as above
%\end{itemize}

\subsection{Self-Shielded Coils}

A way to decouple the internal coil from the magnetic shield is to design a self-shielded
coil~\cite{bib:cpviolwithoutstrangeness,bib:someotherselfshieldedcoilpapers}.
In self-shielded coils, the return flux is provided by a second larger
coil, rather than through the permeable material of the magnetic
shield.  In a perfect self-shielded coil, the field at the position of
the magnetic shield would be zero, resulting in a reaction factor that
is identically unity.

Such coils would completely decouple the properties of the magnetic
shield from the homogeneity and stability of the coil itself.  Changes
in $\mu$ of the shield material would then have no impact on the nEDM
experiment.  Coils incorporating self-shielding in their design are
therefore an attractive option for nEDM
experiments~\cite{bib:cpviolwithoutstrangeness}.


%\begin{itemize}
%\item Explain principle (reaction factor = 1, or no field at shield so
%  no return flux)
%\item Simple analytic results - reaction factor is identically unity.
%\item FEMM/OPERA - demonstrate that sensitivity is reduced by factor
%  of XX for simple geometry.
%\item One graph, or include on previous graph?
%\end{itemize}

\subsection{Summary of $B_0(\mu)$}
For the shield-coupled coils the magnetic field in the region interior
to the coil is coupled to the properties of the magnetic shell which is caused
by the penetration of the magnetic field flux into the shell material. In a
typical nEDM experiment, the sensitivity of the internal magnetic
field to changes in $\mu$ is $\frac{\mu}{B}\frac{dB}{d\mu}\sim 0.01$.
The coupling can be much reduced by replacing the shield-coupled coils
with the self-shielded coils.

\section{Measurements of $\mu(T)$}

\subsection{Previous Measurements and their Relationship to nEDM Experiments}
The interest in the soft magnetic alloys and their properties have
been increased in the last few
decades~\cite{bib:pfeifer,bib:bozorth,bib:couderchon}. Couderchon et
al. measured the thermal variation of $\mu$ of two different Ni-Fe
alloys in a low field and they found $\frac{1}{\mu}\frac{d\mu}{dT}\simeq$1\%/K at room
temperature~\cite{bib:couderchon}. Based on the data sheet of a
similar material, $\mu$ would depend on temperature as
$\frac{1}{\mu}\frac{d\mu}{dT}\simeq$0.3-0.7\%/K~\cite{bib:kruppvdm}. These
are measurements of the temperature dependence of $\mu$ at frequencies
much higher than the nEDM experiment (50~Hz compared to 0.01~Hz). In
addition, the applied magnetic field $H$ and magnetic flux density $B$
in these experiments are not clear while the static magnetic field for
the nEDM experiment is about 1~$\mu$T.

In the present work, two different approaches to measure temperature
dependence of $\mu$ were pursued. To elucidate the behavior of our
passive mu-metal shields, experiments were done using two witness
cylinders, which are smaller open-ended cylinders (6" in length) made
of the same material and annealed at the same time as our big
prototype shields. We therefore expect they have the same magnetic
properties as the big passive shields, but they are much smaller and
easier to perform measurements with.
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Coucheron et al.?
%\item Krupp-VDM data sheet?
%\item Proper literature search on past measurements of $\mu(T)$.
%\item State caveats in order to use these:  dependence on B, H, f.
%\item State typical B, H, f that nEDM needs.  Motivates additional
 % measurements.
%\end{itemize}

\subsection{Summary of $\mu(T)$}
%Insert Summary Here.
The overall error bar in $\mu$ from both measurement techniques is 0.1\%/K $\leq \frac{1}{\mu}\frac{d\mu}{dT} \leq$ 2.3 \%/K and it is consistent with previous data.
Comparing to the static nEDM experiment with $f < 0.01$ Hz, these measurements are mostly done at frequencies close to 1 Hz. Hence, the effective $\mu$ extracted from these type of experiments give
only a qualitative information on the actual nEDM experiment situation and to reach higher accuracy the nEDM experiment has to be built. 
\section{Summary and Conclusions}
The magnetic field internal to the passive shields as a function of $\mu$ for spherical geometry with parameters close to the ILL nEDM experiment has been analytically calculated and compared to axis-symmetric simulations with similar parameters for both spherical and cylindrical geometries. For spherical geometry $\frac{dB_0}{d\mu}\sim 4 \times 10^{-13}$ and it can be much reduced for the shield coupled coils.
The temperature dependence of $\mu$ has been measured by two different techniques using open-ended mu-metal cylinders with 6 inches in length. The overall result gives 0.1\%/K$\frac{1}{\mu}\frac{d\mu}{dT}$2.3 \%/K. Because of the different values in $f$, $B$ and $H$ fields as opposed to the nEDM experiments, these  measurements help to set the specifications for the actual nEDM setup. The nonlinearities in the witness cylinder material such as hysteresis dominated the systematic uncertainties at both measurements and so it was difficult to achieve consistent sub-percent determinations although the sign and the magnitude of the problem was in agreement.
To achieve the required 1~pT stability in the internal field, the temperature should be controlled to 0.1 K level.
The next step is to measure $\mu(T)$ for the nEDM setup with different coil geometries to achieve the best stability.



%\begin{itemize}
%\item We determined $dB_0/d\mu$.  For reasonable parameters its $\sim$ XXX.  For self-shielded it's reduced by a factor of XXX for realistic windings.
%\item We measured $d\mu/dT$.  We constrained it to be in the range 0.1
 % to 2.3 percent per Kelvin.  Dominant errors are XXX for each method.
  %Neither method is for correct B, H, f.  Both methods are very
  %difficult to achieve consistent sub-percent determinations, but tend
  %to agree on sign and magnitude of problem.
%\item Results imply temperature stability to XXX Kelvin for stability
 % goal of XXX pT.  Show that this could be a dominant issue for
  %stability for future experiments.  Not addressed by many other
  %measurements which tend to focus on stability at zero field or
  %overall stability in full EDM experiment.
%\item Future work: build full EDM experiment.  Capability of various
 % internal coil geometries and best achievable temperature stability
  %are both important to success.
%\end{itemize}
