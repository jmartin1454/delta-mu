\begin{abstract}
Future experiments seeking to measure the neutron electric dipole
moment (nEDM) require stable and homogeneous magnetic fields.
Normally these experiments use a coil internal to a passively
magnetically shielded volume to generate the magnetic field.  The
stability of the magnetic field generated by the coil within the
magnetically shielded volume may be influenced by a number of factors.
The factor studied here is the dependence of the internally generated
field on the magnetic permeability $\mu$ of the shield material.  We
provide measurements of the temperature-dependence of the permeability
of the material used in a set of prototype magnetic shields, using
experimental parameters nearer to those of nEDM experiments than
previously reported in the literature.  Our measurements imply a range
of $\frac{1}{\mu}\frac{d\mu}{dT}$ from 0-2.7\%/K. Assuming typical
nEDM experiment coil and shield parameters gives
$\frac{\mu}{B_0}\frac{dB_0}{d\mu}=0.01$, resulting in a temperature
dependence of the magnetic field in a typical nEDM experiment of
$\frac{dB_0}{dT}=0-270$~pT/K for $B_0=1~\mu$T.  The results are useful
for estimating the necessary level of temperature control in nEDM
experiments.

\section{Introduction}

The next generation of neutron electric dipole moment (nEDM)
experiments aim to measure the nEDM $d_n$ with proposed precision
$\delta d_n\lesssim
10^{-27}~e\cdot$cm~\cite{bib:nedm2,bib:nedm2.5,bib:nedm3,bib:nedm3.5,bib:nedm5,bib:nedm6,bib:nedm6.5,bib:nedmtriumf}.
In the previous best experiment \cite{bib:baker,bib:pendlebury} which
discovered $d_n<3.0\times 10^{-26}~e\cdot$cm (90\% C.L), effects
related to magnetic field homogeneity and instability were found to
dominate the systematic error.  A detailed understanding of passive
and active magnetic shielding, magnetic field generation within
shielded volumes, and precision magnetometry is expected to be crucial
to achieve the systematic error goals for the next generation of
experiments.  Much of the research and development efforts for these
experiments are focused on careful design and testing of various
magnetic shield geometries with precision
magnetometers~\cite{bib:brys,bib:afach,bib:fierlingerroom,bib:sturmthesis,bib:patton}.

In nEDM experiments, the spin-precession frequency $\nu$ of neutrons
placed in static magnetic $B_0$ and electric $E$ fields is measured.
The measured frequencies for parallel $\nu_+$ and antiparallel $\nu_-$
relative orientations of the fields is sensitive to the neutron
electric dipole moment $d_n$
\begin{equation}
h\nu_\pm=2\mu_nB_0\pm 2d_nE
\end{equation}
where $\mu_n$ is the magnetic moment of the neutron.

A problem in these experiments is that if the magnetic field $B_0$
drifts over the course of the measurement period, it degrades the
statistical precision with which $d_n$ can be determined.  If the
magnetic field over one measurement cycle is determined to $\delta
B_0=10$~fT, it implies an additional statistical error of $\delta
d_n\sim 10^{-26}~e\cdot$cm (assuming an electric field of $E=10$~kV/cm
which is reasonable for a neutron EDM experiment).  Over 100 days of
averaging, this would make a $\delta d_n\sim 10^{-27}~e\cdot$cm
measurement possible.  Unfortunately the magnetic field in the
experiment is never stable to this level.  For this reason,
experiments use a comagnetometer and/or surrounding atomic
magnetometers to measure and correct the magnetic field to this
level~\cite{bib:baker,bib:brys,bib:afach}.  Drifts of 1-10~pT in $B_0$
may be corrected using the comagnetometer technique, setting a goal
magnetic stability for the $B_0$ field generation system in a typical
nEDM experiment.

In such experiments, typically $B_0=1~\mu$T is used to provide the
quantization axis for the ultracold neutrons.  The $B_0$ magnetic
field generation system typically includes a coil placed within a
passively magnetically shielded volume.  The passive magnetic shield
is generally composed of a multi-layer shield formed from thin shells
of material with high magnetic permeability (mu-metal).  The outer
layers of the shield are normally
cylindrical~\cite{bib:nedm2,bib:nedm3.5} or form the walls of a
magnetically shielded room~\cite{bib:altarev2014,bib:altarev2015}.
The innermost magnetic shield is normally a specially shaped shield,
where the design of the coil in relation to shield is carefully taken
into account to achieve adequate homogeneity
\cite{bib:baker,bib:nedm3,bib:nedm5}.

Mechanical and temperature changes of the passive magnetic
shielding~\cite{bib:voigt,bib:thiel}, and the degaussing
procedure~\cite{bib:thiel,bib:altarev2015,bib:fierlinger2016} (also
known as demagnetization, equilibration, or idealization), affect the
stability of the magnetic field within magnetically shielded rooms.
Active stabilization of the background magnetic field surrounding
magnetically shielded rooms can also improve the internal
stability~\cite{bib:voigt,bib:afach,bib:franke}.  The current supplied
to the $B_0$ coil is generated by an ultra-stable current
source~\cite{bib:brys}. The coil must also be stabilized mechanically
relative to the magnetic shielding.

One additional effect, which is the subject of this paper, relates to
the fact that the $B_0$ coil in most nEDM experiments is magnetically
coupled to the innermost magnetic shield.  If the magnetic properties
of the innermost magnetic shield change as a function of time, it then
results in a source of instability of $B_0$.  In the present work, we
estimate this effect and characterize one possible source of
instability: changes of the magnetic permeability $\mu$ of the
material with temperature.

While the sensitivity of magnetic alloys to temperature variations has
been characterized in the past~\cite{bib:couderchon,bib:kruppvdm}, we
sought to make these measurements in regimes closer to the operating
parameters relevant to nEDM experiments.  For these alloys, it is also
known that the magnetic properties are set during the final annealing
process~\cite{bib:gupta,bib:bozorth,bib:kruppvdm}.  In this spirit we
performed our measurements on ``witness'' cylinders, which are small
open-ended cylinders made of the same material and annealed at the
same time as other larger shields are being annealed.

The paper proceeds in the following fashion:
\begin{itemize}
\item The dependence of the internal field on magnetic permeability of
  the innermost shielding layer for a typical nEDM experiment geometry
  is estimated using a combination of analytical and finite element
  analysis techniques.  This sets a scale for the stability problem.
\item New measurements of the temperature dependence of the magnetic
  permeability are presented.  The measurements were done in two ways
  in order to study a variety of systematic effects that were
  encountered.
\item Finally, the results of the calculations and measurements are
  combined to provide a range of temperature sensitivities that takes
  into account sample-to-sample and measurement-to-measurement
  variations.
\end{itemize}

\section{Measurements of $\mu(T)$\label{sec:tdep}}

\subsection{Previous Measurements and their Relationship to nEDM Experiments\label{sec:previousmeasurement}}

Previous measurements of the temperature dependence of the magnetic
properties of high-permeability alloys have been summarized in
Refs.~\cite{bib:couderchon,bib:bozorth,bib:pfeifer}.  These
measurements are normally conducted using a sample of the material to
create a toroidal core, where a thin layer of the material is used in
order to avoid eddy-current and skin-depth
effects~\cite{bib:pfeifer,bib:kruppvdm}.  A value of $\mu$ is
determined by dividing the amplitude of the sensed $B_m$-field by the
amplitude of the driving AC $H_m$-field (similar to the method
described in Section~\ref{sec:transformer}).  Normally the frequency
of the $H_m$-field is 50 or 60~Hz.  The value of $\mu$ is then quoted
either at or near its maximum attainable value by adjusting the
amplitude of $H_m$.  Depending on the details of the $B_m-H_m$ curve
for the material in question, this normally means that $\mu$ is quoted
for the amplitude of $H_m$ being at or near the coercivity of the
material~\cite{bib:couderchon,bib:kruppvdm}, resulting in large values
up to $\mu_r=4\times 10^5$.

It is well known that $\mu$ measured in this fashion for toroidal,
thin metal wound cores depends on the annealing process used for the
core.  There is a particularly strong dependence on the take-out or
tempering temperature after the high-temperature portion of the
annealing process has been
completed~\cite{bib:pfeifer,bib:kruppvdm,bib:couderchon}.  Such
studies normally suggest a take-out temperature of 490-500$^\circ$C.
This ensures that the large $\mu_r=4\times 10^{5}$ is furthermore
maximal at room temperature.  Slight variations around room
temperature, and assuming the take-out temperature is not controlled
to better than a degree, imply a scale of possible temperature
variation of $\mu$ of approximately
$\left|\frac{1}{\mu}\frac{d\mu}{dT}\right|\simeq 0.3$-1\%/K at room
temperature~\cite{bib:couderchon,bib:kruppvdm}.

A challenge in applying these results to temperature stability of nEDM
experiments is that, when used as DC magnetic shielding, the
high-permeability alloys are usually operated for significantly
different parameters ($B_m$, $H_m$, and frequencies).

For example, when used in a shielding configuration, the effective
permeability is often measured to be typically $\mu_r=20,000$ rather
than $4\times 10^5$.  This arises in part because $H_m$ is well below
the DC coercivity.  As noted in Section~\ref{sec:calculation}, a more
appropriate $H_m$ for the innermost magnetic shield of an nEDM
experiment is $<0.007$~A/m, whereas the coercivity is
$H_c=0.4$~A/m~\cite{bib:kruppvdm}.  The frequency dependence of the
measurements could also be an issue.  Typically, nEDM experiments are
concerned with slow drifts at $<0.01$~Hz timescales whereas the
previously reported $\mu(T)$ measurements are performed in an AC mode
at 50-60~Hz.


The goal of our experiments was to develop techniques to characterize
the material properties of our own magnetic shields post-annealing, in
regimes more relevant to nEDM experiments.


We created a prototype passive magnetic shield system in support of
this and other precision magnetic field research for the future nEDM
experiment to be conducted at TRIUMF.  The shield system is a
four-layer mu-metal shield formed from nested right-circular
cylindrical shells with endcaps.  The inner radius of the innermost
shield is 18.44~cm, equal to its half-length. The radii and
half-lengths of the progressively larger outer shields increase
geometrically by a factor of 1.27.  Each cylinder has two endcaps
which possess a 7.5~cm diameter central hole.  A stove-pipe of length
5.5~cm is placed on each hole was designed to minimize leakage of
external fields into the progressively shielded inner volumes.  The
design is similar to another smaller prototype shield discussed in
Ref.~\cite{bib:nmorpaper}.  The magnetic shielding factors of each of
the four cylindrical shells, and of various combinations of them, were
measured and found to be consistent with $\mu_r\sim 20,000$.

%3.5~$\mu$T applied external axial and transverse fields at frequencies
%$<0.1$~Hz, where the uncertainty in $\mu_r$ comes a model uncertainty
%resulting from incomplete inclusion of the geometry.

In our studies of the material properties of these magnetic shields,
two different approaches to measure $\mu(T)$ were pursued.  Both
approaches involved experiments done using witness cylinders made of
the same material and annealed at the same time as the prototype
magnetic shields.  We therefore expect they have the same magnetic
properties as the larger prototype shields, and they have the
advantage of being smaller and easier to perform measurements with.

The two techniques employed to determine $\mu(T)$ were the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item measuring the low-frequency AC axial magnetic shielding factor
  of the witness cylinder as a function of temperature, and
\item measuring the temperature-dependence of the slope of a minor B-H
  loop, using the witness cylinder as a transformer core, similar to
  previous measurements of the temperature dependence of $\mu$, but
  for parameters closer to those encountered in nEDM experiments.
\end{enumerate}
We now discuss the details and results of each technique.

\section{Relationship to nEDM experiments\label{sec:relationship}}
%\subsection{Summary of $\mu(T)$}

Neutron EDM experiments are typically designed with the DC coil being
magnetically coupled to the innermost magnetic shield.  As discussed
in Section~\ref{sec:calculation}, if the magnetic permeability of the
shield changes, this results in a change in the field in the
measurement region by an amount
$\frac{\mu}{B_0}\frac{dB_0}{d\mu}=0.01$.

The temperature dependence of $\mu$ has been constrained by two
different techniques using open-ended mu-metal witness cylinders
annealed at the same time as our prototype magnetic shields.  We
summarize the overall result as
0.0\%/K~$<\frac{1}{\mu}\frac{d\mu}{dT}<$~2.7\%/K, where the range is
driven in part by material properties of the different mu-metal
cylinders, and in part by day-to-day fluctuations in the temperature
slopes.



We note the following caveats in relating this measurement to nEDM
experiments:
\begin{itemize}
\item Although the measurement techniques rely on considerably larger
  frequencies and different $H_m$-fields than those relevant to
  typical nEDM experiments, we think it reasonable to assume the
  temperature dependence of the effective permeability should be of
  similar scale.  For frequency, both techniques typically used a 1~Hz
  AC field, whereas for nEDM experiments the field is DC and stable at
  the 0.01~Hz level.  Furthermore, in one measurement technique the
  amplitude of $H_m$ was $\sim 0.004$~A/m and in the other was $\sim
  0.1$~A/m.  For nEDM experiments $H_m<0.007$~A/m and is DC.
\item Both measurement techniques extract an effective $\mu$ that
  describes the slope of minor loops in $B_m-H_m$ space.  A more
  correct treatment would include a more comprehensive accounting of
  hysteresis in the material, which is beyond the scope of this work.
\end{itemize}

Assuming our measurement of
0.0\%/K~$<\frac{1}{\mu}\frac{d\mu}{dT}<2.7$\%/K and the generic EDM
experiment sensitivity of $\frac{\mu}{B_0}\frac{dB_0}{d\mu}=0.01$
results in a temperature dependence of the magnetic field in a typical
nEDM experiment of $\frac{dB_0}{dT}=0-270$~pT/K.  To achieve a goal of
$\sim 1$~pT stability in the internal field for nEDM experiments, the
temperature of the innermost magnetic shield in the nEDM experiment
should then be controlled to the $<0.004$~K level if the worst-case
dependence is to be taken into account.  This represents a potentially
challenging design constraint for future nEDM experiments.

As noted by others~\cite{bib:cpviolwithoutstrangeness}, the use of
self-shielded coils to reduce the coupling of the $B_0$ coil to the
innermost magnetic shield is an attractive option for EDM experiments.
The principle of this technique is to have a second coil structure
between the inner coil and the shield, such that the net magnetic
field generated by the two coils is uniform internally but greatly
reduced externally.  For a perfect self-shielded coil, the field at
the position of the magnetic shield would be zero, resulting in
perfect decoupling, which is to say a reaction factor that is
identically unity.  For ideal geometries, such as spherical
coils~\cite{bib:brown, bib:wheeler,bib:purcell} or infinitely long
sine-phi coils~\cite{bib:bethBNL,bib:bethUSpatent,bib:bidinosti}, the
functional form of the inner and outer current distributions are the
same, albeit with appropriately scaled magnitudes and opposite sign.
More sophisticated analytical and numerical methods have been used
extensively in NMR and MRI to design self-shielded
gradient~\cite{bib:turner,bib:hidalgo},
shim~\cite{bib:brideson,bib:forbes}, and transmit
coils~\cite{bib:bidinosti,bib:kuzmin}, and should be of value in the
context of nEDM experiments, as well.  We are also pursuing novel
techniques for the design of self-shielded coils of any arbitrary
field profile and geometric shape~\cite{bib:crawford}.



\section{Conclusion}

In the axial shielding factor measurement, we found
0.6\%/K~$<\frac{1}{\mu}\frac{d\mu}{dT}<2.7\%$/K, with the measurement
being conducted with a typical $H_m$-amplitude of 0.004~A/m and at a
frequency of 1~Hz.  In the transformer core case, we found
0.0\%/K~$<\frac{1}{\mu}\frac{d\mu}{dT}<2.2\%$/K, with the measurement
being conducted with a typical $H_m$-amplitude of 0.1~A/m and at a
frequency of 1~Hz.

The primary caveat to these measurements is that both measurements
(transformer core and axial shielding factor) do not truly measure
$\mu$.  Rather they measure observables related to the slope of minor
hysteresis loops in $B_m-H_m$ space.  They would be more appropriately
described by a hysteresis model like that of Jiles~\cite{bib:jiles},
but to extract the temperature dependence of all the parameters of the
model is beyond the scope of this work.  Instead we acknowledge this
fact and relate the temperature dependence of the effective $\mu$
measured by each experiment.

We think it is interesting and useful information that the two
experiments measure the same scale and sign of the temperature
dependence of their respective effective $\mu$'s.  This is a principal
contribution of this work.

In future work, we plan to measure $B_0(T)$ directly for nEDM-like
geometries using precision atomic magnetometers.  We anticipate based
on the present work that self-shielded coil geometries will achieve
the best time and temperature stability.
