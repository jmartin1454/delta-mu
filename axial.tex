\subsection{Axial Shielding Factor Measurements\label{sec:axial}}


In these measurements, a witness cylinder was used as a magnetic
shield.  The shield was subjected to an AC magnetic field.  The
amplitude of the shielded magnetic field $B_s$ was measured at the
center of the witness cylinder.  Changes in $B_s$ with temperature
signify a dependence of the permeability $\mu$ on temperature.  The
relative slope of $\mu(T)$ can then be calculated using
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{\mu}\frac{d\mu}{dT}=-\frac{\frac{1}{B_s}\frac{dB_s}{dT}}{\frac{\mu}{B_s}\frac{dB_s}{d\mu}}.
\label{eqn:axial}
\end{equation}
The numerator was taken from the measurements described above. The
denominator was taken from finite-element simulations of the shielding
factor for this geometry as a function of $\mu$.

This technique is quite different than the usual transformer core
measurements conducted by other groups.  As shall be described, it
offers an advantage that considerably smaller $B_m$ and $H_m$ fields
can be accessed.


\subsubsection{Experimental Apparatus for Axial Shielding Factor Measurements}
%\subsubsection{Magnetic Field Generation}

The witness cylinder was placed within a homogeneous AC magnetic
field.  The field was created within the magnetically shielded volume
of the prototype magnetic shielding system (described previously in
Section~\ref{sec:previousmeasurement}) in order to provide a
controlled magnetic environment.  A short solenoid inside the
shielding system was used to produce the magnetic field.
%The radius and the half
%length of the solenoid is 17.44~cm while the radius and the half
%length of our innermost prototype passive shield is 18.44~cm.
The solenoid has 14 turns with 2.6~cm spacing between the wires.  The
solenoid was designed so that the field produced by the solenoid plus
innermost shield approximates that of an infinite solenoid.  The
magnetic field generated by the solenoid was typically 1~$\mu$T in
amplitude.  The solenoid current was varied sinusoidally at typically
1~Hz.
%The $\mu$ dependence of the reaction factor for the solenoid is known
%to be considerably smaller than the $\mu$ dependence of the axial
%magnetic shielding factor of the witness cylinder.  Hence the
%temperature dependence of the amplitude of the field measured by the
%fluxgate can be ascribed to changes of the witness cylinder, rather
%than changes in the innermost magnetic shield.


% Need to explain ``local coil'' as well, right here, right now.

%\subsubsection{Witness cylinder and fluxgate magnetometer}

The witness cylinder was placed into this magnetic field generation
system as shown schematically in Fig.~\ref{fig:geometry}.  The
cylinder was held in place by a wooden stand.

A Bartington fluxgate magnetometer Mag-03IEL70~\cite{bib:bartman} (low
noise) measured the axial magnetic field at the center of the witness
cylinder.  The fluxgate was a ``flying lead'' model, meaning that each
axis was available on the end of a short electrical lead, separable
from the other axes.  One ``flying lead'' was placed in the center of
the witness cylinder, the axis of the fluxgate being aligned with that
of the witness cylinder.  The fluxgate was held in place rigidly by a
plastic mounting fixture, which was itself mounted to the witness
cylinder.
% leftovers after Jeff's editing, which might be useful...
% A plastic rod with 2.5~cm diameter used to hold the fluxgate
% flying lead. A hole with a diameter of 0.8~cm was drilled along the
% axis of the plastic rod to reach the middle.  One ``flying lead'' (or
% axis) was held at the hollow center of the holder by a plastic set
% screw. The plastic rod was then placed along the axis of symmetry of
% the witness cylinder and coupled to it by using two plastic end caps
% that threaded onto the plastic rod.  In all data acquisitions, only
% one fluxgate flying lead was used.


To increase the resolution of the measured signal from the fluxgate, a
Bartington Signal Conditioning Unit (SCU) was used with a low-pass
filter set to typically 10-100~Hz and a gain set to typically $>50$.
The signal from the SCU was demodulated by an SR830 lock-in
amplifier~\cite{bib:lockin} providing the in-phase and out-of-phase
components of the signal.  The sinusoidal output of the lock-in
amplifier reference output itself was normally used to drive the
solenoid generating the magnetic field.  The time constant on the
lock-in was typically set to 3 seconds with 12~dB/oct rolloff.

      with a diameter of 30.8~cm and a length of 35.5~cm, containing
      14 turns.  The thickness of the witness cylinder is
      $1/16''=0.16$~cm.  The loop coil (shown in blue) is mechanically
      coupled to the witness cylinder and has a diameter of 9.7~cm.}
    \label{fig:geometry}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

As shall be described in Section~\ref{sec:axialsyst}, a concern in the
measurement was changes in the field measured by the fluxgate that
could arise due from motion of the system components, or other
temperature dependences.  This could generate a false slope with
temperature that might incorrectly be interpreted as a change in the
magnetic properties of the witness cylinder.

To address possible motion of the witness cylinder with respect to the
field generation system, another coil (the loop coil, also shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:geometry}) was wound on a plastic holder mounted rigidly
to the witness cylinder.  The coil was one loop of copper wire with a
diameter of 9.7~cm.  Plastic set screws in the holder fixed the loop
coil to be coaxial with the witness cylinder.

Systematic differences in the results from the two coils (the
solenoidal coil, and the loop coil) were used to search for motion
artifacts.  As well, some differences could arise due to the different
magnetic field produced by each coil, and so such measurements could
reveal a dependence on the profile of the applied magnetic field.
This is described further in Section~\ref{sec:axialsyst}.


%\subsubsection{Temperature measurement and data acquisition}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% It has been moved up from the systematic error section

%
%The mu-metal alloy has a thermal conductivity of 0.35
%W/(cm$\cdot$K). Therefore, four thermocouples placed on different
%spots on the witness cylinder to correct for small temperature
%differences on each end of the witness cylinder.  In these
%measurements, the farther side of the passive shields had the end caps
%while the other side was left open to give access to the interior
%region. Based on the magnetic field maps inside the passive shields,
%for 10 $\mu$T applied magnetic field, the stability of the field was
%to 0.1 $\mu$T level and the magnetic field was even more stable closer
%to the closed side of the passive shields. Therefore the witness
%cylinder was pushed to the side with the end caps on the passive
%shields.


The temperature of the witness cylinder was measured by attaching four
thermocouples at different points along the outside of the cylinder.
This allowed us to observe the temperature gradient along the witness
cylinder.  To reduce any potential magnetic contamination, T-type
thermocouples were used, which have copper and constantan conductors.
(K-type thermocouples are magnetic.)

Thermocouple readings were recorded by a National Instruments NI-9211
temperature input module.  The magnetic field (signified by the
lock-in amplifier readout) and the temperature were recorded at a rate
of 0.2~Hz.

Temperature variations in the experiment were driven by ambient
temperature changes in the room, although forced air and other
techiques were also tested.  These are described further in
Section~\ref{sec:axialsyst}.


\subsubsection{Data and Interpretation\label{sec:axialsyst}}

An example of the typical data acquired is shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:B_vs_Temp}.  For these data, the field applied by the
solenoid coil was 1~$\mu$T in amplitude, at a frequency of 1~Hz.
Fig.~\ref{fig:B_vs_Temp}(a) shows the temperature of the witness
cylinder over a 70-hr measurement.  The temperature changes of
1.4~K are caused by diurnal variations in the laboratory.
% The following statement belongs more in the systematic errors section:
%
% For $f\lesssim 1$~Hz most of the measured fluxgate signal is in the
% in-phase component.
%
The shielded magnetic field amplitude $B_s$ within the witness
cylinder is anti-correlated with the temperature trend as shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:B_vs_Temp}(b).  Here, $B_s$ is the sum in quadrature of
the amplitudes of the in-phase and out-of-phase components (most of
the signal is in phase).  The magnetic field is interpreted to depend
on temperature, and they are graphed as a function of one another in
Fig.~\ref{fig:B_vs_Temp}(c).  The slope in Fig.~\ref{fig:B_vs_Temp}(c)
has been calculated using a linear fit to the data.  The relative
slope at 23$^\circ$C was found to be
$\frac{1}{B_s}\frac{dB_s}{dT}=-0.75\%$/K.

Some deviations from the linear straight-line dependence can be seen
in the data.  For example, when the temperature changes rapidly, the
magnetic field takes some time to respond, resulting in a slope in
$B_s-T$ space that is temporarily different than when the temperature
is slowly varying.  This is typical of the data that we acquired, that
the data would generally follow a straight line if the temperature
followed a slow and smooth dependence with time, but the data would
not be linear if the temperature varied rapidly or non-monotonically
with time.  We also tried other methods of temperature control, such
as forced air, liquid flowing through tubing, and thermo-electric
coolers.  The diurnal cycle followed by the building's air
conditioning was found to be the most stable and gave the most
reproducible results for temperature slopes.

%Another feature of the data was that, on subsequent similar
%measurements, the value of the slope would not be the same, on a
%measurement-to-measurement basis, even if very similar experimental
%parameters were used.  A comprehensive set of systematic studies of
%the factors affecting the slope were performed, and these are
%presented in Section~\ref{sec:axialsyst}.  

% Again don't scoop ourselves here.

%%A basic summary of those
%%studies was that no external parameter was found that could explain
%%the periodic changes in slope that were observed.  Based on these
%%studies, we expect the change in slope is either due to an
%%irreproducibility in the magnetic properties of the material, or due
%%to an uncharacterized systematic error such as a long-time mechanical
%%relaxation of some element of the apparatus.

% Instead of scooping ourselves here, I will leave the following
% discussion to stand for itself in the systematics section.

% To express this uncertainty, we phrase our result as a range of slopes
% that were typical of data acquired.  Taking the full range of
% systematic studies reported in Section~\ref{sec:axialsyst}, we
% measured 0.3\%/K~$<\vert\frac{1}{B}\frac{dB}{dT}\vert<$~0.8\%/K with
% the sign
% % question for Taraneh: should be solenoidal coil only? or what's the
% % answer for solenoidal coils as compared to loop coil?  answer from
% % Jeff and Taraneh, so far: this needs to be fixed.  We should put
% % both measurements up here and explain the difference.
% being negative.  The range also encompasses the typical deviation from
% a linear $B(T)$ in the data (for example, those seen in
% Fig.~\ref{fig:B_vs_Temp}(c).).  Since the data cannot be embodied by a
% single temperature slope, the experiment tends to set a scale and sign
% for the possible temperature dependence, rather than a value.

%\subsubsection{Systematic Studies\label{sec:axialsyst}}

%\paragraph{Field profile dependence and mechanical stability}

%As mentioned earlier, a concern in the measurement was that motion of
%the witness cylinder, the solenoidal coil, and the innermost magnetic
%shield relative to one another could generate a false temperature
%slope.  Another concern was that the spatial variation of the magnetic
%field generated by the coil could somehow affect the measurement.  To
%address these concerns, a loop coil rigidly mounted to the witness
%cylinder was used to search for any differences compared to results
%measured with the solenoidal coil.

%The result of this study was that it did not reduce the typical slopes
%measured, nor improve their reproducibility.  In the end, 
As mentioned earlier, data were acquired for both the solenoid coil
and the loop coil.  Repeated measurements of temperature slopes using
the loop coil fell in the range
0.4\%/K~$<\vert\frac{1}{B}\frac{dB}{dT}\vert<$~1.5\%/K.
% 0.5 is from Page 15 of Taraneh's summary.
% 0.4 is seen on Page 34 of Taraneh's logbook, Volume 1, Aug 2014-Dec 2015.
% 1.5 is from the Figure showed in the paper (page 14 of Taraneh's summary).
Similar measurements for the solenoidal coil yielded
0.3\%/K~$<\vert\frac{1}{B}\frac{dB}{dT}\vert<$~0.8\%/K.
% 0.3 is from Page 30 of Taraneh's summary
% 0.75 is from Page 34 of Taraneh's logbook, Volume 1, Aug 2014-Dec 2015.

In general, the slopes measured with the loop coil were larger than for
the solenoidal coil.  A partial explanation of this difference is
offered by the field profile generated by each coil, and its
interaction with the witness cylinder.  This is addressed further in
Section~\ref{sec:axialsims}.

The range of slopes measured in different trials varied within the
stated ranges.  We conclude that whatever is causing the slopes to
change periodically is likely unrelated to motion of the witness
cylinder relative to the magnetic elements in the system, given that
the loop coil data has a similar range as the solenoid coil data,
despite the more rigid mounting of the loop coil.


% What is the value of the systematic error deduced from this study?
% I would say that the result of this study was that we got similar
% data to Fig. 3(c).  Therefore the systematic error due to field
% profile is smaller than the unknown systematic error of Fig. 3(c)
% and similar figures.  also partly addresses possible changes in
% reaction factor with temperature. (done)

Several other possible systematic effects were considered, all of
which were found to give uncertainties on the measured slopes
$<0.1\%$/K.  These included: thermal expansion of components including
the witness cylinder itself, temperature variations of the magnetic
shielding system within which the experiments were conducted,
degaussing of the witness cylinder, and temperature slopes of various
components e.g. the fluxgate magnetometer and the lock-in amplifier.

The stability of the system was also tested by replacing the mu-metal
witness cylinder with a copper cylinder of very similar dimensions.
The apparatus was then run through its usual experimental cycle over
several days, and this was done multiple times for different
parameters such as coil current.  For all measurements the temperature
dependence of the demodulated magnetic was $<0.1$\%/K, giving
confidence that unknown systematic effects contribute below this
level.


% \paragraph{Different Witness Cylinders}
%
% The manufacturer of our prototype magnetic shields provided us with
% three witness cylinders.  All three were used in these measurements.
% Different cylinders possessed systematically different temperature
% slopes, although always within the ranges quoted above.  These changes
% are believed to arise from the manufacturing and annealing process.
% It is known that the take-out temperature in the annealing process has
% a strong effect on the temperature slopes measured at
% 50~Hz~\cite{bib:kruppvdm}.

Based on the systematic effects that we studied, we conclude that they
do not explain the ranges of values measured for
$\frac{1}{B_s}\frac{dB_s}{dT}$.  We suspect that the range measured is
either some yet uncharacterize systematic effect, or a complicated
property of the material possibly depending on the material history.

% Two possibilities:

% 1. unknown systematic error(s)

% 2. complicated material properties that don't follow a straight line
% could depend on material history themselves.

% Therefore we state a range which should be indicative of the scale
% of possible temperature dependence.


\subsubsection{Geometry correction and determination of $\mu(T)$\label{sec:axialsims}}

To relate the data on $B_s(T)$ to $\mu(T)$, the shielding factor of
the witness cylinder as a function of $\mu$ must be known.  Finite
element simulations in FEMM and OPERA were performed to determine this
factor.  The simulations are also useful for determining the effective
values of $B_m$ and $H_m$ in the material (sometimes called the
``demagnetization factor'' in the literature), which will be useful to
compare to the case for typical nEDM experiments when the innermost
shield is used as a flux return.


From the simulations the ratio $\frac{\mu}{B_s} \frac{dB_s}{d\mu}$ was
calculated.  A linear model of the material was used where
$\bold{B_m}=\mu \bold{H_m}$ and $\mu$ is a constant independent of
$\bold{H_m}$.  The term $\frac{\mu}{B_s}\frac{dB_s}{d\mu}\neq 1$
because the witness cylinders are open ended, and hence even for very
large $\mu\rightarrow\infty$ the shielding factor asymptotically
approaches a constant rather than infinity.

The simulations differed slightly in their results, dependent on
whether OPERA or FEMM was used, and whether the solenoidal coil or
loop coil were used.  Based on the simulations, the result is
$\frac{\mu}{B_s}\frac{dB_s}{d\mu}=0.42-0.50$ for the solenoidal coil,
with the lower value being given by FEMM and the upper value being
given by a 3D OPERA simulation, for identical geometries.  This is
somewhat lower than the value suggested by
Ref.~\cite{bib:paperno-open-ended} with fits to simulations performed
in OPERA, which we estimate to be 0.6.  We adopt our value since it is
difficult to determine precisely from
Ref.~\cite{bib:paperno-open-ended}.  For the loop coil, we determine
$\frac{\mu}{B_s}\frac{dB_s}{d\mu}=0.56-0.65$, the range being given
again by a difference between FEMM and OPERA.

Combining the measurement and the simulations, the temperature
dependence of the effective $\mu$ (at $\mu_r=20,000$ which is
consistent with our measurements) can be calculated by
equation~(\ref{eqn:axial}).  The results of the simulations and
measurements are presented in Table~\ref{tab:axialsummary}.

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline 
  & $\vert \frac{\mu}{B_s}\frac{dB_s}{d\mu}\vert$ & $\vert \frac{1}{B_s} \frac{dB_s}{dT}\vert$~(\%/K) & $\frac{1}{\mu}\frac{d\mu}{dT}$~(\%/K) \\ 
 & (simulated) & (measured) & (extracted) \\
\hline 
Solenoidal Coil & 0.42-0.50 & 0.3-0.8 & 0.6-1.9 \\ 
\hline 
Loop Coil & 0.56-0.65 & 0.4-1.5 & 0.6-2.7 \\ 
\hline 
\end{tabular} 
\caption{Summary of OPERA and FEMM simulations and shielding factor
  measurements, resulting in extracted temperature slopes of $\mu$.}
\label{tab:axialsummary}
\end{center}

\end{table}

Combining the loop coil and solenoidal coil results, we find
0.6\%/K~$<frac{1}{\mu}\frac{d\mu}{dT}<2.7\%$/K to be a reasonable
range for the possible temperature slope of $\mu$.

As stated earlier, the simulations also provided a way to determine
the typical $B_m$ and $H_m$ internal to the material of the witness
cylinder.  According to the simulations, the $B_m$ amplitude was
typically 100~$\mu$T and the $H_m$ amplitude was typically 0.004~A/m.
These are comparable to the values normally encountered in nEDM
experiments, recalling from Section~\ref{sec:calculation} that
$H_m<0.007$~A/m for the innermost magnetic shield of an nEDM
experiment.  A caveat is that these measurements were typically
conducted using AC fields at 1~Hz, as opposed to the DC fields
normally used in nEDM experiments.
